			<strong>Node.js API Gateway for frontend teams</strong>
			<em>As API Gateway provides functionality for client applications like browsers</em> - it can be implemented and managed by the team who is responsible for the frontend application.

			It also means that language the API Gateway is implemented in language should be chosen by the team who is responsible for the particular client. As JavaScript is the primary language to develop applications for the browser, Node.js can be an excellent choice to implement an API Gateway even if your microservices architecture is developed in a different language.

			Netflix successfully uses Node.js API Gateways with their Java backend to support a broad range of clients - to learn more about their approach read The "Paved Road" PaaS for Microservices at Netflix article
